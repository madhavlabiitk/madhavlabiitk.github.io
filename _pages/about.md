#### Overview 

<p style="line-height: 21px;">Our groupâ€™s research interests lie at the intersection of the theory and application of machine learning - with a focus on applications in computer vision. With a strong interest in the mathematical fundamentals and a passion for real-world application, our group aims on being at the forefront of the field, by publishing in the best of venues in the areas of machine learning and computer vision, while at the same time, being guided by application contexts derived from real-world use. 

In recent years, our work on the algorithmic side has focused on non-convex optimization, explainable machine learning and deep generative models; while our applied work is on domains including agriculture, e-learning, security/surveillance and human behavior understanding. 

As machine learning and Artificial Intelligence continue to make inroads into the daily life of every human, our future research plans focus on the development of machine learning methods for real-world application contexts and challenges, with an emphasis on both theoretical and empirical analysis. </p>
