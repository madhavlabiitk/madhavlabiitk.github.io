Our groupâ€™s research interests lie at the intersection of the theory and application of machine learning - with a focus on applications in audio and speech processing, Physics and dash. With a strong interest in the mathematical fundamentals and a passion for real-world application, our group aims on being at the forefront of the field, by carrying out impactful research in the areas of deep learning, machine learning and speech processing, guided by application contexts derived from real-world use.

*Keywords*: Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Speech Signal Processing, Optimization, Computer Vision, Agriculture, Autonomous Navigation

#### Our problems of interest in recent times have focused on:
* **Learning with limited supervision (or) Label-efficient learning**: This includes problems such as zero-shot learning, few-shot learning, continual learning, active learning, domain adaptation, domain generalization
* **Explainable machine/deep learning**: This includes problems on use of causality in machine learning, adversarial and attributional robustness, disentanglement of latent variables

We are also broadly interested in the theoretical understanding of deep learning, and making deep neural networks faster (to train and test), as well as smaller.

#### From an application standpoint, problems of our recent interest include:
* **Agriculture**: Plant phenotyping using computer vision
* **Drone-based vision**: Detection of objects from drone imagery, as well as low-resolution imagery
* **Autonomous navigation**: adding levels of autonomy to driving vehicles in developing countries, focusing on India
* **Human behavior understanding**: Detection of emotions, human poses, gestures, etc of the human body using images and videos

Please see our Research pages for more information on our research interests, projects, publications, etc.

**Why Lab1055**? Machine Learning and Vision (MLV = 1055 in Roman numerals).

We are grateful to the following organizations whose support sustains our research.
